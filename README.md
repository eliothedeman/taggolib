taggolib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdlayher/taggolib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdlayher/taggolib)
========

taggolib is a Go package which provides read-only access to metadata contained in various audio formats.  MIT Licensed.

taggolib is inspired by the [TagLib](http://taglib.github.io/) and [taglib-sharp](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp/)
projects.  Its goal is to provide read-only metadata access to a variety of audio formats in Go, without the need
to use a TagLib binding.
